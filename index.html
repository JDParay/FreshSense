    <div class="feature-card"><b><h3>Early Odor-Based Detection System</h3></b>
    <p>FreshSense uses an advanced odor sensor that can detect extremely small 
      changes in the air—changes that usually appear hours or even days before 
      mold, bacteria, or contamination become visible.</p>
      <p> By identifying these early warning signs, farmers are given enough 
        time to take action, adjust conditions, and prevent the spread of 
        harmful microorganisms. This early detection greatly reduces the 
        chances of losing large portions of the harvest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card"><b><h3>Real-Time Alerts Through a Mobile App</h3></b>
    <p>The system is connected to an easy-to-use mobile application that sends 
      real-time alerts directly to the farmer’s phone whenever something unusual 
      is detected.</p>
    <p>These notifications come with clear messages, color indicators,
      and simple explanations, making it easy for farmers to understand what might
      be happening in their grow rooms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card"><b><h3>24/7 Automated Monitoring With Low Maintenance</h3></b>
    <p>FreshSense provides continuous, around-the-clock monitoring, ensuring that the
      farm is being checked at all times, situations such as the farmer being away
      or asleep.</p>
    <p>The device works quietly in the background and requires very little maintenance, 
      removing the need for constant manual checking.</p></div>
